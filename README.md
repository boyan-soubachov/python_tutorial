# python_tutorial
This is a simple Python tutorial that will let you get up to speed.

## How do I install Python?
### MacOS
```bash
brew install python3 pyenv-virtualenv
```

### Linux
```bash
apt install python3 python3-virtualenv
```

## Now what?
* If you want to get stuck with some simple interpreter experimentation, run ```python``` in your terminal to open the REPL.
* If you want to write some serious code, create a file in your workspace (i.e. main.py) and to execute it type ```python main.py``` in your terminal.
* Or if you're not a knave and actually want to follow this tutorial, open up the first folder with your code editor.
